# Bastion: Hell or Hell config mod
Inspired by the Devil May Cry "Hell or Hell" difficulty. You die in one hit, while every enemy has regular HP

# Usage
Copy the folder in your Bastion folder. 

Tested on Windows 10

# Notes
You can't die against the first enemy you encounter in the first level, because you have no health bar yet. You gain your health bar after that enemy, and you should now die in one hit.
The game will then think that you have to heal up at the fountain, which is not possible because you only have 1 HP. Fight the enemies that appear and walk around a bit, and the game will let you go on into the saloon.
